# chunkingVideos

This script combines multiple large `.MP4` side-view videos and chunks them into labeled short clips using timing information from an Excel file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg installed on your system
- Python packages: `pandas`, `moviepy`, `openpyxl`

## How to Use
1. Edit `sub_list` in the script to include subject IDs.
2. Ensure files are located at:
/videos/OlderGroup/SideView/{subject_id}/GH01.MP4 ...
/Timeline/{subject_id}_FrontView_Labels.xlsx
3. Run:
```bash
python chunkingVideos.py

Output clips will be saved to:
/home/yourname/Desktop/{subject_id}_side/
